To achieve __Embodied Intelligence__, the AI model must learn to perceive, understand, and act within the world from a human-centric, first-person perspective. My central mission is to pioneer the field of __Egocentric Perception__ for Embodied Intelligence, creating the foundational science and technology for assistive AI agents embedded in wearable devices and collaborative robots. These agents will be capable of seeing, thinking, memorizing, and planning, proactively assisting users in both daily activities and complex professional tasks. This vision directly supports __Digital Transformation__ by engineering the next generation of __human-AI collaboration__. Furthermore, our work directly addresses one of the most critical societal challenges facing the world by developing the assistive technologies essential for __ageing societies__, thereby contributing to a sustainable future. Specifically, my research topics include:

1. Egocentric Perception: Modeling the physical world and human mental states from a first-person view for intention-aware collaboration.
2. 3D Vision and Representation Learning: Building efficient 3D models for actionable spatial reasoning and simulation.
3. Visual Information Processing: Infusing conventional image/video processing and analysis with new perspectives and novel viewpoints.
