Welcome! I am currently a [Research Assistant Professor](https://research.polyu.edu.hk/en/persons/yi-wang-3) in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering ([EEE](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eie/)), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (香港理工大学, [PolyU](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/)). I am also working in the JC STEM Lab of Machine Learning and Computer Vision with [Prof. CHAU Lap Pui](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eee/people/academic-staff-and-teaching-staff/prof-chau-lap-pui/). My research interest includes __Image/Video Processing, Computer Vision, Intelligent Transport Systems, and Digital Forensics__.

I received BEng in Electronic and Information Engineering and MEng in Signal and Information Processing from Northwestern Polytechnical University (西北工业大学, [NPU](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/)), China, and earned PhD in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering ([EEE](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/eee/)) from Nanyang Technological University (南洋理工大学，[NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/)), Singapore, in 2021, supervised by Dr. CHAU Lap Pui, who worked as an A/P at NTU (till 2022) and is currently a Prof. at PolyU.

Prior to joining PolyU, I worked as a Research Fellow in EEE, NTU until March 2023 with PI [A/P YAP Kim Hui](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp01044). Prior to going to Singapore, I was involved in national projects and a robotics center at NPU, China, supervised by [Prof. WAN Shuai](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/en/wanshuai.html) and [Prof. MEI Shaohui](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/en/meishaohui.html).

<!-- I earned my PhD in Political Science from the
[University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) and my
B.A. in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu).
My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*,
*Political Science Research and Methods*, and *PS: Political Science & Politics*,
among other outlets. This [research](research) explores the causes and
consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While primarily
focused on civil conflict, it also examines contentious political phenomena
including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develops new measures of
institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
in both quantitative methodology and international relations, and am a certified
instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org). -->
