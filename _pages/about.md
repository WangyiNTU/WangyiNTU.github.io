Welcome! I am currently a [Research Assistant Professor](https://research.polyu.edu.hk/en/persons/yi-wang-3) in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering ([EEE](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eie/)), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (香港理工大学, [PolyU](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/)). I worked closely with [Prof. CHAU Lap Pui](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eee/people/academic-staff-and-teaching-staff/prof-chau-lap-pui/). My research interest includes __Image/Video Processing, Computer Vision, Intelligent Transport Systems, and Digital Forensics__.

I received BEng in Electronic and Information Engineering and MEng in Signal and Information Processing from Northwestern Polytechnical University (西北工业大学, [NPU](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/)), China, and earned PhD in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering ([EEE](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/eee/)) from Nanyang Technological University (南洋理工大学，[NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/)), Singapore, in 2021. My PhD is supervised by Dr. CHAU Lap Pui, who worked as an A/P at NTU (till 2022) and is currently a Prof. at PolyU. 

Prior to joining PolyU, I worked as a Research Fellow in EEE@NTU until March 2023 with PI [A/P YAP Kim Hui](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp01044). Prior to going to Singapore, I was involved in national projects and a robotics center at NPU, China, supervised by [Prof. WAN Shuai](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/en/wanshuai.html) and [Prof. MEI Shaohui](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/en/meishaohui.html).
